		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This site attempts to pay homage to the venerable Roland TR-808 by creating a usable interface to access the original sounds over the internet.</p>
		<h2>Technical</h2>
		<p>TR808.online uses Node.JS on the backend and jQuery and jQuery UI on the frontend.  It is hosted by DigitalOcean.</p>
		<h2>Thanks</h2>
		<p>Mad props to the following projects: <a href="https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/tree/2.0">Howler.JS</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg">fluent-ffmpeg</a>, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>, 
		<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.JS</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.  Without awesome people creating amazing open source libraries and frameworks 
			like these, sites like this would not be possible.<br>This would also not be possible without the contributors at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
